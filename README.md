Getting started üé¨
This readme focuses on practical steps to run and use the dashboard. If you want to dive straight into code, start by exploring the configuration and data modules. The system is designed so you can plug in new data sources, add new factors, and adjust visualization types without breaking existing workflows.

Key prerequisites
- A modern Python environment (3.9+ recommended) or a matching runtime for the frontend framework used.
- Optional Docker if you want containerized runs with minimal setup.
- Access to crypto data sources you plan to use, such as price feeds, on-chain metrics, or exchange data.
- A working development environment for writing and testing Python or TypeScript code, depending on the implementation.

Quick start guide üß≠
Below is a practical path to get up and running quickly. If your environment differs, adapt the steps to your setup.

1) Prepare your environment
- Decide on a runtime: Python-based stack or a containerized setup.
- If using Python:
  - Create a virtual environment:
    - python3 -m venv venv
    - source venv/bin/activate  (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
  - Install dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Install optional extras for data loaders or visualization backends as needed.
- If using Docker:
  - Use the provided docker-compose.yml or Dockerfile to spin up services.
  - Ensure data persistence volumes are configured.

2) Get the code and data
- Clone the repository:
  - git clone https://github.com/alfeel159357/crypto-risk-premia-dashboard.git
- Acquire data sources you intend to test. The repo includes adapters for several data providers and sample datasets for demonstration.

3) Run the dashboard locally
- If the project uses Streamlit:
  - streamlit run app.py
- If the project uses Dash:
  - python app.py
- If the project uses a custom runner:
  - python -m risk_dashboard.main
- Open the address printed in the console (usually http://localhost:8501 or similar).

4) Explore the interface
- Look for panels that let you:
  - Add or remove factors (e.g., momentum, volatility, liquidity, on-chain metrics)
  - Select time windows and asset universes
  - Visualize factor exposures, premia surfaces, and performance metrics
  - Compare noise levels and robustness across settings
- Save and load configurations to reproduce experiments later.

5) Reproduce a simple analysis
- Load a basic factor bundle (e.g., a four-factor mix) and a standard crypto universe (top 50 by market cap).
- Set a fixed seed for reproducibility.
- Run a backtest or historical simulation to observe the premium signal under the same conditions each time.

6) Optional: run in containers or on cloud
- If you use Docker, build and run with docker-compose up -d.
- For cloud environments, map volumes for data and export results to cloud storage if supported.

Data, models, and methods üìö
Data sources
- Price data: crypto assets, cross-asset benchmarks, and liquidity-adjusted price series.
- On-chain metrics: network activity, hashrate, active addresses, transaction counts.
- Market microstructure: bid-ask diffusion, order-flow signals, exchange reserves.
- External signals: sentiment proxies, macro indicators, and policy events.

Modeling approach
- Factor-centric design: each factor captures a distinct risk or opportunity in crypto markets.
- Interaction modeling: factors combine to form multi-factor exposures. The dashboard supports exploring interactions and synergy.
- Handling noise: the system includes noise-aware preprocessing and clipping (z-score clipping or robust scaling) to reduce spurious signals.
- Reproducibility: every run uses explicit seeds, fixed data windows, and versioned code paths. Results are documented with configuration snapshots.

Factor combinations and exploration üîß
- Build factor bundles by selecting base factors we define (e.g., momentum, value signals, liquidity, on-chain health, volatility regime).
- Create interaction terms and composite signals:
  - Multiply or blend signals to create joint exposures.
  - Use ensemble methods to merge signals from different factors.
  - Apply clipping, normalization, or rolling transforms to stabilize signals.
- Compare scenarios:
  - Equal-weighted vs risk-parity weightings
  - Different rebalancing frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
  - Subsets of assets (top cap, mid cap, liquid vs illiquid)

Noise engineering and robustness üß™
- Noise-aware portfolios incorporate methods to separate signal from noise:
  - Add noise simulations to gauge sensitivity
  - Use z-score clipping to limit extreme values
  - Employ bootstrapping to quantify uncertainty
- Robustness checks help identify factors that hold up across regimes, data gaps, and data quality variations.
- The dashboard includes built-in tools to conduct these checks and store results for reproducibility.

Reproducibility and tooling üß∞
- Versioned configurations: each run stores a configuration manifest with parameter values, seeds, and data sources.
- Notebooks and scripts: experiments are documented in notebooks with clear inputs and outputs.
- Data provenance: data loaders log sources, timestamps, and transformations to track lineage.
- Test coverage: unit tests cover core utilities, data loaders, and simple modeling components to guard against regressions.

Customization and extension üé®
- Data sources: swap in new adapters to ingest different data streams.
- Factors: add new base factors or modify weighting schemes.
- Visualization: plug in new charts, layouts, or dashboards for different audiences.
- Backtesting: extend the engine with new metrics, drawdown controls, and risk limits.
- Config files: use YAML or JSON configs to manage experiments without touching code.

Visualization and interactivity üß©
- Interactive heatmaps show factor exposures across assets and time.
- 3D surfaces or contour plots illustrate premium landscapes across multiple dimensions.
- Time-series panels compare returns, drawdowns, and Sharpe ratios for different factor bundles.
- Interactive widgets let you adjust window length, lookback periods, and asset universes on the fly.
- Tooltips provide definitions for each factor, transformation, and metric.

Performance, reliability, and security ‚ö°
- Efficient data pipelines: data loaders cache results and parallelize fetches where possible.
- Memory-conscious visuals: charts render in streaming fashion to avoid freezing for large universes.
- Fail-safes: if data is incomplete, the dashboard falls back to the last valid state and logs the issue.
- Access control (optional): you can layer in authentication for shared dashboards in teams.

Validation, testing, and quality assurance üß™
- Unit tests validate core utility functions, math helpers, and data parsing.
- Integration tests check end-to-end data flows from loader to visualization.
- Backtests and sanity checks reproduce known benchmarks and measure drift.
- Continuous integration runs tests on pull requests to catch regressions early.

How to customize and extend (detailed) üß≠
- Adding a new factor
  - Define the factor in a dedicated module with a clear API: it should expose a signal value, a period, and a method to transform raw data into a signal.
  - Include unit tests to verify the factor's behavior under several market conditions.
  - Add a simple visualization so users can preview how this factor behaves across assets and time.
- Integrating a new data source
  - Implement a data loader class that adheres to the standard loader interface used by the project.
  - Ensure the loader logs the data lineage, timestamps, and any transformations.
  - Provide sample data stubs for testing when the external source is unavailable.
- Custom backtesting and reporting
  - Extend the backtesting module with new metrics (e.g., Sortino ratio, tail risk) and drawdown analysis.
  - Create export scripts to save results as CSV, Parquet, or JSON for reproducibility and external analysis.
- Visualization plugins
  - Add new visualization widgets for different audiences (e.g., researchers, traders, risk managers).
  - Provide configuration options to tailor color schemes, scales, and aggregation levels.
- Performance optimizations
  - Profile critical paths and optimize data transformations.
